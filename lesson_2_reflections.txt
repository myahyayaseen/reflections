Reflection Exercise 1:

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Answer1:

Initializing a repository will create a .git file within the same directory. 
Files within that directory will be untracked in the beginning. We need to do 
this to make that directory a repository. Otherwise it is essentially just a 
directory on our disks.

Reflection Exercise 2:

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

Answer2:

Staging area is different from working directory because it will contain only 
those files that we would like to add whereas working directory contains 
everything that we have in there. 
It lets us add whatever files we would like to add at any point in time rather 
than everything that we have. 
It will be easier for us to choose what we would like to commit and when!

Reflection Exercise 3:

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical 
change?

Answer3:

When files are added to staging area, we can compare that with the working 
directory and also with most recent commit to find out if this something we 
really like to commit.
This comparison help us determine if this is one logical change or more.

Reflection Exercise 4:

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your 
history organized? How would branches help?

Answer4:

When we are trying out a new feature but not sure if it would work.
Or when there is something we want to test while keeping the original code
intact.
Different language versions for different ares or countries.

Reflection Exercise 5:

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

Answer5: 

Diagrams make it easier to understand that where the head is and how 
branches are progressing. If we would like to make progress to a certain 
branch, diagrams help us make sure that we do not leave out any unreachable
commits.
