Reflection Exercise 1:

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Answer1:

Initializing a repository will create a .git file within the same directory. 
Files within that directory will be untracked in the beginning. We need to do 
this to make that directory a repository. Otherwise it is essentially just a 
directory on our disks.

Reflection Exercise 2:

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

Answer2:

Staging area is different from working directory because it will contain only 
those files that we would like to add whereas working directory contains 
everything that we have in there. 
It lets us add whatever files we would like to add at any point in time rather 
than everything that we have. 
It will be easier for us to choose what we would like to commit and when!

Reflection Exercise 3:

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical 
change?

Answer3:

When files are added to staging area, we can compare that with the working 
directory and also with most recent commit to find out if this something we 
really like to commit.
This comparison help us determine if this is one logical change or more.
