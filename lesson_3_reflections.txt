Reflection Exercise 1:

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Answer1:

When I am ready to share my work with others who I would like to contribute it to.
Also, when I am ready to make my local work public so people could see it and help
me with it by adding/editing some of my work.

Reflection Exercise 2:

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Answer2:

GitHub can have changes made by different contibutors which we might not want
to have. In that case,  it could be inconvenient if all changes are pulled 
automatically and at times when we do not want them.
