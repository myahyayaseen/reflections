Reflection Exercise 1:

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Answer1:

When I am ready to share my work with others who I would like to contribute it to.
Also, when I am ready to make my local work public so people could see it and help
me with it by adding/editing some of my work.
